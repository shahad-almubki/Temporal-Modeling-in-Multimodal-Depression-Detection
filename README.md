# Temporal Modeling in Multimodal Depression Detection  
A Critical Review and Cross-Platform Generalization Study

This repository contains an academic **critical review and analytical study**
within the field of **Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning**.
The work focuses on transformer-based multimodal models for depression detection
on social media, with particular emphasis on **temporal modeling**.

## Nature of the Work
This project is a **critical review and experimental analysis** of an existing AI
and deep learning research paper.  
It does **not** propose a new model or dataset, but evaluates and analyzes design
choices and generalization behavior reported in prior work.

## Research Focus
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Deep Learning
- Multimodal Learning
- Transformer Architectures
- Temporal Modeling (Time2Vec)
- Mental Health AI

## Research Objective
The main objective of this study is to examine:
- The impact of temporal embeddings on multimodal transformer models
- The ability of time-aware models to generalize across different social media
  platforms (e.g., Twitter and Reddit)
- The strengths and limitations of current temporal modeling approaches in
  mental health AI applications

## Methodology
- Architectural and methodological critical review of a time-enriched multimodal
  transformer model
- Comparative analysis between time-aware and time-agnostic transformer settings
- Cross-platform generalization analysis
- Discussion of computational, ethical, and modeling limitations

## Key Findings
- Temporal modeling improves cross-platform generalization performance
- Time-aware models exhibit smaller performance degradation across domains
- Temporal embeddings help capture behavioral patterns beyond content alone
- Several architectural limitations remain, including efficiency and cultural bias

## Limitations and Challenges
- Dependence on pre-trained deep learning models with potential bias
- Limited linguistic and cultural diversity in datasets
- Quadratic complexity of transformer architectures
- Performance evaluation based solely on social media signals

## Recommendations for Future Work
- Explore more efficient transformer architectures (e.g., Longformer, Performer)
- Replace mean pooling with attention-based pooling
- Extend evaluation to non-English and cross-cultural datasets
- Incorporate finer-grained temporal mood variation modeling
